				<p>Lead-based paint and its dust, usually found in older buildings, are common sources of exposure. Young children are especially at risk. Occupational exposure, such as welding, is a more common cause for adults.
Symptoms include developmental delays, abdominal pain, neurological changes and irritability. At very high levels, it can be fatal.
Treatment always involves avoiding further exposure to lead or lead-based products and may include medication to help remove lead from the body.</p>
